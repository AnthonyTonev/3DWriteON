The 3 input panels are as follows - Widht, Height and Depth. When creting primitive shapes such as Cube or Pyramid you can determine how their dimmentions are distributed. In other words you make different shapes. There are settings on the null object and a particle effect on the solid layer. There is also an option to add fill so you can color faces.
